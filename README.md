# Libft
---
My first own C library. Developed as a part of syllabus of 42 Silicon Valley.
List of all functions are stored in [*function_list.txt*](https://github.com/ytanne/libft/blob/master/function_list.txt).

# Installation
---
Clone the repository to a directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ytanne/libft.git libft
```
Run make to get library.
```
cd libft && make && make clean
```
Voila, you get the libft.a that has all listed functions. 
# Uninstallation
---
To clean up the mess after the make run the following.
```
make fclean 
```
Optional
```
cd .. && rm -rf libft
```
